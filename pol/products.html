                <p>Our ponds are: 1) designed* to provide the best possible habitat for your guests, 2) designed with modern and attractive shapes, and 3) made with reliable techniques and the use of the highest quality materials**. We offer 200, 400, 800 and 1200 liter tanks.</p>
                <p>* The design of our ponds respects the traditional rule of proportions: Width = 1/2 of the length; depth = 1/3 of the length. These dimensions allow our ponds to achieve ideal levels of oxygenation of the water and a greater population of fish per surface area. ** All our ponds are triple reinforced with polyamide fibers, making them the strongest on the market.</p>

                <h3><img src="images/plant02.jpg" alt="plant img">Plants</h3>
                <p>There are three broad categories of aquatic plants: submersible plants, floating plants, and riparian plants. Among the submersible plants, the options that best adapt to our sunny climate are: Foxtail, Ludvigia, Cabomba verde, Elodea (Canadian Pondweed) and Vallisneria. Among the floating plants we have to offer you: Water lily, Water hyacinth, Water lettuce and Duckweed. Finally, to complete our pond, marsh plants cannot be missing such as: Achira, Cala (Zantedeschia aethiopica), False Papyrus (Cyperus alternifolius), Papyrus (Papyrus cyperus) and Garden Bamboo.</p>

                <h3><img src="images/fishes01.jpg" alt="fishes img">Fishes</h3>
                <p>The existing variety is enormous, but we will focus only on freshwater fish. There are two types, tropical and cold water. 1) Tropical water fish: They are the most colorful and showy. They will serve us “only for indoor ponds”, located in a warm place in our house or apartment (the temperature should never drop below 20°C). Among them we find viviparous fish such as Guppies, Platys, Xiphos and Mollies; and oviparous fish such as Bettas. 2) Cold water fish: They allow us to place our pond outside. Among the best known species are Goldfishs, Koys, Barbos Schubertis, Chinese Neons, Paradises, etc. All these species tolerate the cold well, but they have a hard time on days of high temperatures.</p>
