                <h3>Fishes</h3>
                <p><img src="images/fishes01.jpg" alt="fishes img">The existing variety is enormous, but we will focus only on freshwater fish. There are two types, tropical and cold water. 1) Tropical water fish: They are the most colorful and showy. They will serve us “only for indoor ponds”, located in a warm place in our house or apartment (the temperature should never drop below 20°C). Among them we find viviparous fish such as Guppies, Platys, Xiphos and Mollies; and oviparous fish such as Bettas. 2) Cold water fish: They allow us to place our pond outside. Among the best known species are Goldfishs, Koys, Barbos Schubertis, Chinese Neons, Paradises, etc. All these species tolerate the cold well, but they have a hard time on days of high temperatures.</p>
