            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><img src="images/my_image_1.jpeg" alt="My photo">I have been an aquarist since the middle of 2020. Since I was a child I have always been attracted to nature and have studied and practiced various activities related to it (gardening, animal husbandry, camping, etc.). However, I had a pending subject, aquarism. Due to some prejudices that arose in my childhood (as a child I had an aquarium and my fish died) I did not have enough motivation to face an adventure like this. Finally, in the middle of the year 2020 the planets aligned. Due to the extra idle time (because of the government-imposed lockdown in the pandemic) and some saved money I had, I was able to dedicate myself to researching and experimenting enough to understand the natural fundamentals that govern a pond. This, added to other manual skills, allows me to carry out this project and offer you a complete product that will provide you with countless moments of entertainment and satisfaction. - David Galvan</p>
